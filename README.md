# Project Inspiration

College is a big place with a diverse group of individuals and therefore we cannot always keep track of our items.You may end up losing personal stuff e. earbuds or misplace your smartphone which is very relatable to most  college students.I aim to solve this by building a automated way to help students with quick recovery of
their lost and found items 

# Features
* Get notified when a lost/found item is listed.
* "Response Validation" technique is used to prevent false claim and preventing misuse of information.
* Keep track of your listed items/response.
* Simple and Easy to use.


# Technologies Used
* React JS (Frontend)
* Node JS, Express JS (Backend)
* MongoDB (Database)
